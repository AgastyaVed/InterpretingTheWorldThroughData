#### An exploration of Indian General elections. 
Indian general elections are conducted every 5 years. With more than a billion people India is world's largest democracy. In addition to the size it being a a multi-party democracy adds to complications when it comes to choices. 

As a first experiment trying to gauge the intentions and to provide a quantitative measure of the biggest parties I have carried out a text mining project. I have used the party manifestos to identify what are the most frequently used words. This is a good way of starting off with the analysis.

These are jupyter notebooks and the data used for this project are available to the public for free.

The manifesto for each party was downloaded from their respective website.
